                        <p><h4>General Pest control </h4>We provide monthly, bi-monthly and quarterly  services for general pest control. These pests include cockroaches, spiders, ants and scorpions. We spray the outside and inside of the structure. This creates a barrier that is meant to terminate the pests before they get into your home.  Upon request we will treat the inside of your home, this is recommended if you have a specific issue that needs to be tended to (i.e. ants ect).</p>

                        <p><h3>Bee Removal</h3>Our goal when dealing with bees is to preserve them and move them to our apiary so they can continue their vital role in our Eco system. There are sometimes when the bees will not make it or we will do too much damage to the building to save the bees. </p>

                    <div>
                        <p><h3>Termites and inspections</h3>We offer a termite inspection. We will come to your house and inspect the inside and the outside of your structure to see if there is any evidence of termites. We offer two different termite treatments. We have a pre-treatment, when the house is still under construction. The other option is post-treatment, this is typically when the house is sold. We create a barrier around the house in the soil. There is a warranty that is transferable and  lasts for 5 years. After the initial warranty you can continue your coverage by getting your home inspected every year there after, for an additional inspection cost each year. </p>

                        <h3>Bed Bugs</h3>One of the most common bugs we deal with is bed bugs. These bugs like to be in cracks and crevices around the bed, couch and where humans spend long hours sedentary. To treat a house for bed bugs we take all the blankets, sheets and pillows off the bed and we treat the entire mattress, box spring, and frame. To treat a couch we take all the cushions off the couch and treat in all the cracks of the couch. We also treat the base boards of the dwelling. We advise our clients to wash all the blankets, sheets and pillow cases. This service usually requires a follow-up treatment with in 2 to 4 weeks after the first treatment.</p>

                        <p><h3>German Roaches</h3>German roaches are a specific breed of cockroach. They are small, about the size of a sunflower seed when fully grown. They typically live on the underside of lower cabinets in the kitchen and bathrooms and behind refrigerators. To treat these we use a couple special pesticides which are sprayed under the cabinets and behind the refrigerator. We also treat the baseboards inside. Treating outside with these types of roaches does not help kill them. This service usually requires a follow-up treatment with in 2 to 4 weeks after the first treatment.</p>

                <div>
                    <p><h3>History</h3>Brad Kohler was working at Smith’s grocery store in the 1990s with four small children all under the age of 11. He always wanted to work for himself and saw a need in our community for quality pest control services. After opening the doors of Desert Oasis Pest Control, in 1996, his kids grew up around this business. Currently Brad has two sons working for him and in the past his oldest son worked for him for many years. To say that Brad build this business from the ground up is an understatement. Over the years Desert Oasis Pest Control has grown with the needs of Las Cruces. We are always working on the best way to serve our customers. Brad used to fill up his tanks with a compressor at his home before he came up with the idea of putting a compressors on every truck so we can fill our tanks quickly with pressure, while at an appointment.  We have made a trailer with all our equipment on it, to do our termite post treatments in a very efficient way. Safety is our number one priority. </p>
